# 🚀 MultiTool AI RAG Project

Welcome to the **MultiTool AI RAG Project**! This project leverages cutting-edge technologies like **Astra DB** and **Groq** to build a powerful Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. It combines document retrieval, natural language processing, and AI-driven responses to provide intelligent answers to user queries.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Document Retrieval**: Fetch relevant documents from a vector store.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Use Groq's ultra-fast language models for generating responses.
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Retrieve information from both vector stores and Wikipedia.
- **Streamlit UI**: A user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Astra DB**: A serverless, scalable, and highly available database built on Apache Cassandra.
- **Groq**: A lightning-fast AI accelerator for running large language models.
- **LangChain**: A framework for building applications powered by language models.
- **Streamlit**: A Python library for creating interactive web apps.
- **Hugging Face**: For embeddings and NLP tasks.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. **Set Up the Environment**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/multitool-ai-rag.git
   cd multitool-ai-rag
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment using `conda`:
   ```bash
   conda create -p venv python==3.10 -y
   conda activate ./venv
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

### 2. **Set Up Environment Variables**

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```plaintext
   ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN=AstraCS:your-token-here
   ASTRA_DB_ID=your-database-id-here
   GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key-here
   SERPER_API_KEY=your-serper-api-key-here
   USER_AGENT=MultiToolGenAI/1.0
   ```

2. Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials:
   - **Astra DB Token**: Get it from your Astra DB dashboard.
   - **Astra DB ID**: Found in your Astra DB dashboard.
   - **Groq API Key**: Sign up at [Groq](https://groq.com/) to get your API key.
   - **Serper API Key**: Sign up at [Serper](https://serper.dev/) for search functionality.

---

### 3. **Run the Application**

Start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to interact with the app.

## 📝 How It Works

1. **Document Indexing**:
   - The app loads documents from specified URLs.
   - Splits them into chunks using a text splitter.
   - Embeds the chunks using Hugging Face embeddings.
   - Stores the embeddings in Astra DB.

2. **Query Routing**:
   - The app routes user queries to either the vector store or Wikipedia based on relevance.

3. **Response Generation**:
   - For vector store queries, it retrieves relevant documents and generates responses using Groq.
   - For Wikipedia queries, it fetches information directly from Wikipedia.
